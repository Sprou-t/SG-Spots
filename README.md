# SG Spots

### TODO:

#### frontend
-   set up api logic:just like in notes, find a way to stack up the api req to get the data like title, img...
-   in frontend, use useEffect for when pg loads
-   then to prevent too much api call need to restrict api call maybe to once per hour and to do that we need to save the info in our db
