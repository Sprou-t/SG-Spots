TODO:

at least 5 days
1. user auth following fullstackopen. just use console.log first to confirm
the state of logging in. after that edit navbar accordingly
2. navbar: add: profile pic + blog + translation + search icon + sign out. 
3. add the comment feature
4. deal with api call

after mvp:
- find a way to make the main content of some pages to get the correct margin that can avoid the nav height
(this is prob solved if i construct each individual pagae with the components)
- refactor code to use zustand
- add blog feature
- create tests
