TODO:

at least 5 days

2. navbar:
    - add: do conditional rendering of user's initial alphabets + sign out. follow airbnb profile - add pic + blog + search icon + sign out.
3. add the comment feature

    - design the comment component
    - connect frontend action to backend: use buttons for create, edit, and delete (finish until at least here)
    - do auth based operation

- max until thurs need to finish

4. deal with api call

    - dateline: try monday

5. improve upon product: ui and add blog feature compulsory (optional: zustand and write tests)
6. after mvp:

- find a way to make the main content of some pages to get the correct margin that can avoid the nav height
  (this is prob solved if i construct each individual pagae with the components)
- refactor code to use zustand
- add blog feature
- create tests
- navbar being transparent with white text is not ok for homepage wtf!
