5. improve upon product: ui and add blog feature compulsory (optional: zustand and write tests)
6. after mvp:
- do authentication with google and facebook

- find a way to make the main content of some pages to get the correct margin that can avoid the nav height
  (this is prob solved if i construct each individual pagae with the components)
